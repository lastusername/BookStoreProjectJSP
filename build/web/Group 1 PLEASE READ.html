<!--The Following files are currently Unused and/or left from Mr. Duffy's example code!!:
(They will likely not be part of the final project)

main.css
normalize.css
normalize.min.css

(the following .jsp files were re-worked into new ones)
details.jsp -> specificBookPage.jsp

(the html are used for references to convert into the corresponding  .jsp files.
checkout.html -> checkout.jsp
mainPage.html -> mainPage.jsp
specificBookPage.html -> specificBookPage.jsp

(courses.html needs to be implemented to and search.jsp, searchResults.jsp)
courses.html -> search.jsp + searchResults.jsp

(P.S.)
If you go in netbeans to Services -> Databases -> the bookstore database
right-click jdbc:derby://localhost:1527/bookstore and select [Execute Command...]
then type [    select * from BooksQuery  ] and hit run statement, you can see what's in the database.

At the bottom of the footer are hyperlinks to test different pages. However, they're a bit buggy.
